      Polygon.io's unified numerical mapping for condition codes.
      Each feed/exchange uses its own set of codes to identify conditions, so the same
      condition may have a different code depending on the originator of the data. 
      Polygon.io defines its own mapping to allow for uniformly identifying a condition across feeds/exchanges.
