summary: Condition Mappings
description: |
  Get a unified numerical mapping for conditions on trades and quotes.  Each feed/exchange uses its own set of codes to identify conditions, so the same condition may have a different code depending on the originator of the data. Polygon.io defines its own mapping to allow for uniformly identifying a condition across feeds/exchanges.
